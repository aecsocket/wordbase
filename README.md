# Features

what's missing in the engine?
- anki integration
- non-Japanese support
- more dictionary formats support

TODO:
- extended test sesh:
  - [ ] sometimes when hovering, the lookup is done, BUT the popup isn't focused maybe?
  - [ ] chinese fonts (force switch away from Inter?)
  - [x] overlay opacity should update when you modify it
  - [x] incorrect furigana
    - 聞き流す - ききながす
    - 言い争い - いいあらそい
    - 言い直す - いいなおす
  - [x] why do some things get the wrong char length?
    - ショックでだろう -> should just be ショック
    - 日常だった -> should just be 日常
    - "共に" -> chars as 共, but should be 共に
  - [x] add lindera tests for the above
  - [ ] if clicking the mouse while sentence motion, it should NOT lookup
  - [ ] this fails to lookup:
    - 居たたまれなくなって
      - because: root form is 居たたまれない
    - 仕えする
    - 向き合わせになる
  - [x] click dragging on the overlay popup should let you drag it
  - [ ] I really want a scrollback, but the current sentence goes to the bottom + there's enough padding at the bottom to push the scrollback up out of the way
  - [x] dictionary popup settings button is literally invisible, need to add OSD class somehow
    - fixed by making the card background transparent
  - [x] changing dictionaries from the popup window?
    - we don't need this, you have a button to open the manager anyway
  - [ ] 停学処分 - we have lookups for:
    - (停学処分, ていがくしょぶん) -> jitendex
    - (停学処分, NULL) -> audio
    - can we merge the 2 somehow?
    - 体育会系 as well
    - won't fix
    - ok I lied about won't fix. I really do want to fix this somehow.
  - [ ] TONS of stack trace errors in journalctl. we need a way to only send them as error messages to the dbus client from the extension
  - [ ] イカす is improperly deinflected - lindera thinks it's 活かす/生かす
    - how about: when we deinflect e.g. イカす to 活かす, we ALSO generate a deinflection which maps to the same substring length as 活かす, BUT is a substring of the original query it self (イカす)?
    - uughhhhh idk
  - [ ] the "is ready" popup keeps coming up
  - [ ] sometimes the dictionary IS spawned, but doesnt appear in front of the window. maybe `make_above` is not being applied?
    - yes, it's as I guessed. it's not being set as `make_above`. maybe related to below?
  - [ ] or maybe it's to do with the window not found error from the extension. we should fix that
- sesh 2:
  - IPAex Gothic looks *really* nice
  - [ ] まじない -> deinflects as 呪い, and prioritises 呪い (のろい). can we make it prioritse まじない?
  - [ ] my top priority HAS to be making anki notes from lookups
  - [x] 頼りなさげな目を... - scans as <頼りな>さげな... we need extra lindera continuation rules for this case
    - <肩をおとし>て
    - <叩きつけ>ていた
    - <消えてたじゃない> -> <きえてた>じゃない
  - [ ] つまらねぇ - lindera/unidic doesn't seem to be able to turn this into つまらない. do we hardcode some rules like ねぇ -> ない?
    - handwritten deinflector? 🤔
  - [x] 関係ない furigana is wrong?
    - [ ] added a test case, but idk how to resolve it. failing test.
  - [x] ともなると - in DOJG, the line breaks are done wrong. \n should be replaced with <br/>. let's do this in the renderer, not the importer.
  - [ ] popup should dynamically anchor itself to the topleft/topright/etc. shouldn't be up to the requester. e.g. if it's in the bottom 50% of the screen, anchor it to a top corner
  - 大事 has a lot of pitch accents, will be good for testing PA rendering
  - [ ] 当てられまくる授業だった - need better lookup for 当たられまくる. dicts?
  - [x] I accidentally fullscreened the overlay. this should be impossible!
  - [x] a button in the overlay to copy the sentence
  - [x] a button in the overlay to go to the manager search field immediately, or an inline search? idk exactly

- overlay settings: font size, overlay opacity, lookup mode (hover, hold shift, hold ctrl, hold alt)
- good gnome integration - DONE
- Better stylesheet
- AnkiConnect
- Optional AI integration
  - Receives context of the looked up sentence (let's say 1 sentence before and after), and asks AI to generate an explanation
  - Can include extra metadata from the app e.g. video file name, browser tab title, so the AI has more context on what the user is doing
  - Local-first support via Ramalama

TODO:
- local audio server - SORTA DONE
- ankiconnect

quick test problems:
- clicking off the overlay box, then it updates the sentence, and I start hovering back on - it doesn't immediately show popup box until I hover over a different word and back
- when the app goes full screen, the overlay should appear at the top
- dictionary popup should always appear above

audio server:
- i query たべなかった
- i get the term "食べる (たべる)"
- i get audio bytes as a record

FUTURE ROADMAP:

I don't like how `Term` is hardcoded to a headword and reading. It's totally possible to have multiple readings for the same headword, i.e. a hiragana katakana and reading for the same kanji. And things like NHK16 Yomichan local audio dict use katakana readings for pronunciation. It'd be really useful to support that, but we just don't right now.

However I also don't want a `reading_1`, `reading_2`, `reading_3` etc columns in the database. It's theoretically possible to do that, but that's really ugly.

I want to rewrite the Yomitan importer to take advantage of async. But how will it affect parsing performance? Since right now we can use multicore to parse all of the entries in parallel. But our bottleneck is inserting them into the database. Need to investigate more.

what happens we import a yomitan dictionary?

- we import (expr 日本語 reading にほんご)
  - we know for a fact that にほんご is a reading of 日本語
  - we don't know for certain whether 日本語 is a headword, but it probably is

- or: we import (expr 日本語 reading ())
  - we don't know what 日本語, it could be a reading or a headword
  - for now we'll treat it as a headword, but if we get evidence of the contrary (i.e. an entry where reading = 日本語), then we'll change our mind

- or: we import (expr () reading にほんご)
  - if we've already imported (日本語, にほんご) then this term already exists, skip
  - else, we don't know if this is a headword or a reading yet. assume it's a headword for now

querying:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS term (
    text      TEXT    NOT NULL CHECK (text <> ''),
    record    INTEGER REFERENCES record(id),
    headword  INTEGER REFERENCES term(id),
    UNIQUE  (text, record)
);

- if we search for X, our goal is to find any terms where `term.text = X`
- if we find a bunch of terms, but all their `headword = NULL`, then we ASSUME that X is a headword, not a reading
- if we find at least 1 `term` for which `headword != NULL`, then X is a READING of 1 or more headwords
  - where `headword = Y AND headword != NULL`, pull in any terms where `term.text = Y` - and mark Y as the headword
- TODO: what if those terms pulled in also have `term.headword != NULL`? should that be allowed?

OR: have a headword and term tables

## Overview

### Terms, records, and lookups

We start with the concept of a *term*, which is the key for what you would typically consider a "dictionary entry". For example, the term "rust" would be a key for:
- the definitions of the word "rust"
  1. coating of iron oxide on iron formed by oxidation
  2. a programming language
  3. a video game developed by Facepunch Studios
- the pronunciation information for the word "rust"
  - /rəst/
- how often the word "rust" appears in a corpus
  - occurs about 3 times per million words according to the [Oxford English Dictionary][oed]

[oed]: https://www.oed.com/dictionary/rust_n1

Each of these pieces of information is called a *record*, and each record is of a specific *kind*. A term can have any number of records, and can have multiple records of the same kind. A term may also have both a *headword* and a *reading*, to support languages where the same word can have multiple forms. For example, for the term "錆", the headword is "錆" and the reading is "さび". Querying for either of these will result in the same records being returned.

However, terms may not always appear in the exact headword or reading form. For example, searching for "eating" will not give the records for "eat", as they are two separate terms. This is where *deinflection* comes in, which will transform "eating" into "eat". Users don't need to worry about how this happens - this is the responsibility of the Wordbase engine.

The combination of "deinflect this term into its canonical form" and "query the database for records for this term" is called a "lookup", and is at the heart of Wordbase.

### Dictionaries

To get records, we import them from a *dictionary*. There are many formats of dictionaries that exist in the wild, and Wordbase aims to support as many as possible (or at least, makes it easy to add new ones). Dictionaries can be imported via the Wordbase app, and once added, they can be reordered, disabled, or removed. Placing a dictionary higher in the ordering makes its records appear earlier when looking up a term, giving it a greater priority.

You can also mark a single dictionary as a *sorting dictionary*, which will be used to sort records in a lookup. The records are sorted by what *frequency* that term has in the sorting dictionary. If a term appears more often - i.e. it has a lower ranking, or a higher occurrence - it will appear earlier in the results.

### Profiles

You may want different settings for different situations, e.g. use a different set of dictionaries when studying Japanese versus when studying Mandarin. For this, you can create different *profiles* and switch between them in the app or when performing lookups. Each profile stores its own settings, and tracks which dictionaries are enabled separately.

Not all state is separate between profiles - for example, the actual dictionaries you have imported, and their ordering, is common across all profiles. App-level settings such as the AnkiConnect URL and selected theme are also shared across profiles.

### API and the popup dictionary

External apps may want to use Wordbase's dictionaries and lookup functions without having to include Wordbase in their app themselves - for example, a video player or web browser extension where you can click on words to see their definitions. To support this, Wordbase apps expose an API for developers to perform lookups.

Even though external apps can perform lookups, they don't necessarily have to implement all of the logic for rendering those lookup results. Instead, if it is supported on the current platform, they can request the server to spawn a dictionary popup at a specific location relative to the app's own window. This will automatically handle scanning the text, performing the record lookup, creating the popup window, and positioning it. Wordbase's goal is to make it as simple as possible for 3rd party developers to integrate with the dictionary.

### Texthooker overlay

Japanese learners who use visual novels to study are likely familiar with the concept of a texthooker like [Textractor]. This is an app that hooks into the memory of the visual novel you're playing, and extracts the text from the current dialog box to be displayed in another app where you can perform lookups. The traditional approach of using a texthooker is:
- you open your visual novel
- you open your texthooker and attach it to the game
- you open a web browser with [Yomitan] and a clipboard inserter extension
- you open a blank texthooking page, which pastes the contents of your clipboard into the page
- when a new sentence appears, the texthooker reads it from memory
- texthooker copies it to clipboard
- browser extension copies clipboard contents to webpage
- scan the text in the webpage

Wordbase simplifies this:
- you open your visual novel
- you open your texthooker and attach it to the game
- when a new sentence appears, you see it appear as scannable text in an overlay above the game window
- scan the text in the overlay

This is achieved by Wordbase connecting to your texthooker via [TextractorSender], receiving sentences, and pushing those sentences into an overlay window which sits on top of your VN. This window then integrates with the rest of Wordbase by triggering a popup dictionary when selecting a word.

### Anki integration

After looking up a word, you may want to add it to your Anki deck to study it later. Wordbase allows you to connect to an [AnkiConnect] server, which adds a button to the popup dictionary allowing you to add the word as a note to your specified deck. This will also ask the app which originally requested the popup to provide an image and sentence audio for the note, so you can get the most context-specific information for your note.

## Projects

### 📦 `wordbase`

Provides the core API types, and defines the protocol for communicating with the engine (which actually performs most of the logic). This includes all of the kinds of records that the engine may store and provide.

### 📦 `wordbase-engine`

This is the heart of Wordbase, which implements the logic for:
- managing and selecting profiles
- importing, managing, and deleting dictionaries
- storing dictionary records in a database
- performing deinflection
- performing lookups
- connecting to texthooker servers

The engine is a library, not a binary - it is intended to be packaged inside of an app. This is because the engine only implements the platform-agnostic logic, and cannot perform platform-dependent actions like spawning a popup dictionary. The app may also choose to not support some functions (i.e. on a mobile platform, you may not be able to spawn a popup on top of the currently active app).

The engine also does not handle allowing clients to communicate with the engine, and leaves this up to the app (via e.g. a WebSocket server, DBus, or some other form of IPC).

### ⚙️ `wordbase-desktop`

This is a GTK/Adwaita app which runs on the desktop, and runs `wordbase-engine` plus exposes ways for clients to talk to the engine via a WebSocket server and DBus. This app targets the Linux GNOME desktop as the first-class target, and aims to follow modern Linux desktop app standards, including using Wayland and being compatible with Flatpak sandboxing. However, it also aims to be as cross-platform as possible (though not necessarily as native as possible on other platforms). This implements the logic for:
- running and persisting an engine instance
- rendering dictionary contents, and allowing users to search all dictionaries
- showing a user-friendly GUI to manage the engine
- spawning an overlay window when a texthooker is connected
- importing dictionary files
- running a WebSocket server (requires extra Flatpak permissions)
- on Linux, providing the DBus service over the app's known name

### ⚙️ `wordbase-mobile`

TODO: could we make a mobile app? Have it use accessibility APIs to render on top of other app content, and show a popup?

### 📦 `wordbase-client-tokio`

Provides API for interacting with a Wordbase engine through a WebSocket server. Uses Tokio and Tungstenite for the WebSocket implementation.

### 🧩 `wordbase-integration`

GNOME extension to integrate Wordbase into Mutter, by allowing the app to request the window manager to perform window manager-specific actions, e.g. set the position of the popup window.

## Popup dictionary

Wordbase clients may request the server to spawn a pop-up dictionary to query for some client-provided text at a client-specified position (relative to its own surface). This makes it stupid simple for clients to integrate pop-up dictionary functionality, as they don't need to handle performing a lookup or rendering contents; they just request the server to handle it for them.

This pop-up is shown as a window which is placed above all other windows on the desktop, and is integrated into the server itself. It is not a standalone binary which can be launched outside of the server. It uses a single WebView which covers the entire surface, and renders all dictionary content into there.
However, this is a fairly platform-specific feature, and comes with some challenges to solve.

### Linux - Wayland

Wayland is the most challenging window manager to target for pop-ups due to its security features, which disallow the client from having much control over its own window. However, it also means that if we design for Wayland first, then we design for the most difficult scenario first, and supporting all other platforms will be easier.

Under Wayland, there is no way for a client to read its own window's X, Y coordinates in screen space, and there is no standard protocol to request the compositor to move your window to a specific coordinate. While this is great for security, and it means other windows can't easily snoop on what your window is doing or mess with the user experience, it puts apps like the pop-up dictionary in a tricky situation.

To solve this, we write compositor-specific extensions which integrate with the compositor itself and have the server request the extension (via DBus, not via WebSockets like other clients) to move the pop-up window to the desired coordinates. Note that this makes the pop-up dictionary basically desktop-specific; however, we aim to support the most commonly used desktops, and it's not particularly hard to make an extension for other compositors which handle this functionality.

### Linux - X11

X11 is a much less restricting (and much less secure) protocol than Wayland in comparison, which means we don't need to hook into the compositor to perform what we want.

TODO: so what do we do? I don't use X11 so...

### Windows

TODO

### MacOS

TODO

### Android + iOS

Unsupported due to platform limitations. Apps can't spawn arbitrary windows on top of other apps.

TODO: this might not be entirely true...
